Today we're exploring AI agents a transformative approach to building systems that's reshaping how we think about software. We'll break down what they are, how they work under the hood, and how we can leverage them in our own projects. So what exactly is an AI agent? It's a helpful software assistant that can monitor what's happening around it, make smart decisions, and take actions to accomplish goals we set for it. But what makes them fundamentally different from traditional software? While conventional programs follow predetermined execution paths, agents actively monitor their environment through inputs and sensors, process information through reasoning engines, make decisions based on goals and available actions, take actions that modify their environment, and learn from feedback to improve performance. This represents a paradigm shift from imperative programming where we tell software exactly what to do to to declarative goal setting, where we define objectives and let the agent determine how to achieve them. Modern AI agents are built on several foundational capabilities that give them their power. First, agent operates across a spectrum of autonomy from systems that merely recommend actions for human approval to fully autonomous agents that make and execute decisions independently. The engineering challenge lies in calibrating this autonomy to for specific use cases, implementing proper guardrails and building appropriate oversight mechanisms. Unlike stateless API endpoints that process each request in isolation, agents maintain persistent memory across interactions. This enables the handling of complex multi step tasks by storing conversation history in vector databases, maintaining state data in structure storage, tracking action results and environmental changes, and passing contextual information between reasoning steps. When we provide this stored context with each interaction, the agent builds upon previous steps rather than starting from scratch, enabling coherent extended workflows. Most modern AI agents use large language models as their reasoning engines. These provide a natural language, understanding, problem solving capabilities and knowledge representation needed to function effectively. But an AI agent isn't just an LLM. The model powers the reasoning, while the agent architecture creates the framework for action. What makes agents particularly useful is their ability to integrate with existing systems. They can execute code, call external APIs, interact with databases, and orchestrate multiple tools to complete complex workflows. When designing these systems, we focus on creating clean interfaces between the agent and its tools, making each component modular and maintainable. There are several common types of AI agents worth exploring. Simple reflex agents map inputs directly to actions, use if then rules without memory. They are perfect for validation checks and monitoring alerts where immediate response matters most. Model based agent tracks world states with internal variables, allowing them to adapt to changing environments. Goal based agents use pathfinding algorithms to chart action sequences that reach defined targets. Learning agents improve through reinforcement techniques constantly adjusting their models based on performance feedback. Utility based agents calculate outcome values using formulas and select the action with the highest expected payoff. This lets them weigh multiple factors when making decisions. When building AI agent systems, we have several architectural options. A single agent architecture deploys one agent as a personal assistant or specialized service. This works well for focused applications, but might struggle with complex challenges that span multiple domains. Multiple agent architectures coordinate specialized agents working together within a shared environment. Research agents gather information. Planning agents develop strategies and execution agents implement solutions. The technical challenge here is designing effective communication protocols between these agents. We might use shared memory spaces or message passing systems to orchestrate their interactions. Often the most practical approach is a human machine collaborative architecture that integrates agent capabilities with human expertise. The agents provide analysis and handle routine execution while humans make critical decisions and provide creative direction. We see this today in pair programming assistance that suggests code alongside developers, augmenting rather than replacing human capabilities. AI agents represent a fundamental evolution in how we build software systems. By understanding these patterns, we can move beyond traditional programming paradigms towards systems that reason, learn, and adapt to changing conditions. These approaches provide powerful new capabilities that can dramatically accelerate our work. If you like our videos, you might like our System Design newsletter as well.
